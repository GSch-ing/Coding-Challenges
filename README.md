This repository contains my solutions to algorithm and data structure challenges from platforms such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).  
It is intended as a **personal practice archive** to track my progress, reinforce problem-solving skills, and improve my proficiency in **Python** and **C++**.
